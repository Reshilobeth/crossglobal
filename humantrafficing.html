            Human Trafficking is the fastest growing crime 
            and the second largest illegal trade in the world. 
            Article 23 of the Constitution of India prohibits the 
            trafficking of human beings and forced labour. Various 
            other Indian laws and India’s ratification of several 
            international laws also clarifies India’s stand on 
            trafficking.

                    In March 2013, India passed the Criminal Law (Amendment) 
                    Act of 2013. This Act amended Section 370 of the Indian 
                    Penal Code and includes India’s first definition of human trafficking.  
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Human-trafficing-two-text-two">
                <p>
                    According to this definition, human trafficking 
                    occurs when one person (the trafficker) uses force, 
                    fraud or coercion to induce, recruit, harbor or 
                    transport another person (the victim) for the 
                    purpose of exploitation for his/her own commercial 
                    gain. It also defines exploitation as “any act of 
                    physical exploitation or any form of sexual exploitation, 
                    slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude, 
                    or the forced removal of organs.” The Act also clarifies 
                    the types of offenses that are criminalized as trafficking 
                    violations and institutes heightened sentences for perpetrators.

                <!-- <h1>"</h1> -->
                <p>
                Bonded Labour is an oppressive form of forced labour where, 
                due to a debt or other obligation (customary, caste-based, 
                economic consideration), the labourer forfeits certain basic 
                rights and freedoms that are guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. 
                Physical violence, verbal insults, brute force and sexual abuse 
                are often common elements in bonded labour making it a serious 
                human rights crime. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="bonded-Labour-text-two">
                <p>
                    The most common form of bonded labour usually entails 
                    an advance. Victims accept a petty cash advance from the 
                    employer, agreeing to repay the amount through their services. 
                    Often, the labourer moves into the worksite with his/her entire 
                    family. Once at the worksite, labourers are curtailed from moving 
                    around freely, denied the chance to supplement their wages through 
                    alternate employment or by selling their goods and also refused the 
                    right to be paid the State-recommended wages
                </p>
                <p>They are told that their freedom will be restored only upon 
                    repayment of the advance. However, as the labourer soon realises, 
                    the entire system has been designed to make repayment impossible. 
                    Abysmally low wages, exorbitant interest rates and falsified 
                    account-keeping ensure that the illiterate labourer is trapped 
                    for years, sometimes generations
                </p>
                <p>The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) lists bonded labour as one of 
                    the various forms of Human Trafficking in India. Human 
                    trafficking is the acquisition of people by improper means 
                    such as force, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting 
                    them. Most times, people are exploited for sex, labour or organs. 
                    Human trafficking is a serious offence and can be tried under 
                    Section 370 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)
                </p>
                <p>In most cases where people have been trafficked for labour, 
                    the conditions are very similar to bonded labour. Most times, 
                    bonded labour offenders can be tried both under the Bonded 
                    Labour Act as well as under Section 370.

                    Sex trafficking or commercial sexual exploitation (CSE) is 
                    a ‘rape for profit’ trade, in which victims are kidnapped, 
                    coerced, deceived, transported or detained for the purpose 
                    of being sexually exploited for commercial gains. Although 
                    CSE and related forms of human trafficking clearly violate 
                    international human rights conventions, the crime brings in 
                    significant profits for the offenders and thus continues to 
                    be a growing industry.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    Sex trafficking is a criminal offence under Article 23 
                    of the Constitution of India, Immoral Traffic (Prevention) 
                    Act, 1956, and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) regardless of 
                    the consent of the victim. If the victims are minor, 
                    perpetrators can also be tried under the POCSO 
                    (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act, 2012.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once trafficked, the victims face violence on a daily basis. 
                    In addition to being raped multiple times a day, both children 
                    and forced adults are particularly vulnerable to violent 
                    physical abuse from owners, pimps and customers. They are 
                    also at a significantly higher risk of contracting HIV or 
                    sexually transmitted diseases. Often, they receive a mere 
                    fraction of the profits from their exploitation or none at all, 
                    making it impossible for them to provide basic amenities for 
                    themselves.
